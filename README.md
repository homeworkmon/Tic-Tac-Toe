# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Odin Project's Javascript [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe)

Built using minimax recursive function to simulate ai player at three levels of difficulty!

Inspiration from [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ) explanation of minimax function (so helpful!!) as well as the implementation of difficulty levels inspired by [@Pety99](https://github.com/Pety99/tic-tac-toe) & [Vodjnov](https://github.com/vdojnov/Superhero-Tic-Tac-Toe) (thank you!!)

What I learned:
1. RECURSION!!! Recursion used to terrify me - implementing the AI logic for this game correctly made me so happy and improved my understanding of the concept much more deeply
2. Using factory functions to create objects instead of constructors
3. Immediately Invoked Function Expressions and using the Javascript module pattern to organize private and public methods + calling those methods outside modules (scope & Closure)
